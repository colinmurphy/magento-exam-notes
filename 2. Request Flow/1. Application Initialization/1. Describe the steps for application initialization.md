# Describe the steps for application initialization

# Overview

1. index.php
2. Mage::run($mageRunCode, $mageRunType);
3. Mage_Core_Model_App->run(array $options);
4. Mage_Core_Model_App->baseInit()
5. Mage_Core_Model_Config->loadBase()
6. Mage_Core_Model_App->\_initModules();
7. Mage_Core_Model_App->\_initCurrentStore($scopeCode, $scopeType);
8. Dispatches the Front Controller - more information [here](https://github.com/colinmurphy/magento-exam-notes/blob/master/2.%20Request%20Flow/2.%20Front%20Controller/2.%20Describe%20the%20role%20of%20the%20front%20controller.md)

# 0. Request Flow Image

Belvg have created an excellent image which covers the whole chapter - [http://blog.belvg.com/wp-content/files/magento_request_flow.jpg](http://blog.belvg.com/wp-content/files/magento_request_flow.jpg)



# 1. index.php


1. Checks PHP Requirements
2. Checks for Compiler and includes compiler classes
3. Checks for downloader and if so exits
4. Checks for maintenance.flag and if exists exits
5. Includes Mage.php file
6. Checks for server run_code and run_type
7. Runs Mage Mage::run($mageRunCode, $mageRunType);


### 1.1. Notes on MAGE_RUN_CODE and MAGE_RUN_TYPE

**MAGE_RUN_TYPE**

By default this is "store" if there is no server MAGE_RUN_TYPE set

- store (store view)
- website (website)
- group (store)


**MAGE_RUN_CODE**

This is the code e.g. base or german and the value is associated to which store/group/website you need to load.

**Examples:**

1. German website

    SetEnv MAGE_RUN_TYPE "website"
    SetEnv MAGE_RUN_CODE "german"


2. German Store View/Store

    SetEnv MAGE_RUN_CODE "german"


**Note:** These are used further along in the initialization process at *Mage_Core_Model_App->\_initCurrentStore($scopeCode, $scopeType)*


# 2. Mage::run($code, $store);

**Note:** Before we begin looking at this, please note that at the top of the file the autoloader and include paths have been [set](https://github.com/colinmurphy/magento-exam-notes/blob/master/1.%20Basics/1.%20Architecture/6.%20Explain%20class%20naming%20conventions%20and%20their%20relationship%20with%20the%20autoloader.md).

Overview

1. Checks for options (3rd parameter)
2. Calls app class Mage_Core_Model_App
3. Sets the application as installed
4. Sets the config model Mage_Core_Model_Config with the array of options
5. Calls apps run - Mage_Core_Model_App->run(array $options);


### 2.1 Notes

Please note that if an option exists config_model then that Config model will be used instead.
I am not sure why you would want to do this.


# 3. Mage_Core_Model_App->run(array $options);

1. Loads local.xml and config.xml in baseInit()
2. Checks is request is cached and sets response
3. Otherwise it loads the modules in \_initModules(); and also runs resource update/install scripts
4. Loads Area (frontend/admin/install)
5. Sets the current store from parameters
6. Runs Data script update (different to resource update scripts)
7. Calls the front controller

# 4. Mage_Core_Model_App->baseInit($options)

1. Sets the error handler
2. Initiates the config
3. Sets the options in the config class
4. Loads the config.xml and local.xml into Config Class -  Mage_Core_Model_Config->loadBase()
5. Initiates caching

# 5. Mage_Core_Model_Config->loadBase()

This merges the XML from under app/etc into the config class.
So basically config.xml and local.xml would be merged in the config class.

So it does the following:

- Loads the XML files under app/etc e.g. config.xml and local.xml using *glob*
- Loops through these files
- Clones Mage_Core_Model_Config_Base
- Adds xml from the file to this class
- Merges Mage_Core_Model_Config_Base into Mage_Core_Model_Config

# 6. Mage_Core_Model_App->\_initModules();

So in Mage_Core_Model_App->run() we check if the request is cached and return the cache if it exists.

Other we call this method and this does the following if the modules are not already cached:

- Load Modules
- Merges config data from Database
- Runs Resource Install/Update scripts
- Processes and configuration values in the config.xml
- Saves Cache

### 6.1 Loading modules

Mage_Core_Model_Config->loadModules();

- Loads modules under app/etc/modules using glob
- Loads modules it depends on
- Merges config.xml into config node of class Mage_Core_Model_Config
- **Important:** Merges back in local.xml file afterwards to prevent overrides

Then it runs setup updates by checking version numbers of the modules against the database table core_resource.

### 6.2 Merges Config data from database

Mage_Core_Model_App::loadDb()

### 6.3 Runs Resource Install/Update scripts


     Mage_Core_Model_Resource_Setup::applyAllUpdates();


Its important to note the name of the class and method for the exam and that this runs before the data scripts.
Data updates are called in the applyAllDataUpdates() method of the class.


# 7. Mage_Core_Model_App->\_initCurrentStore($scopeCode, $scopeType);

As mentioned earlier these parameters are set at the end of the index.php and are passed through to Mage::run();


# 8. Important Notes

**Merging Config.xml**

Magento loads config.xml and local.xml and adds them to the config class.
It loads the modules config.xml and merges them into the config class.
It then loads the local.xml file and re-merges it into the config class to prevent overrides by modules.\

**Scripts:**
Resource Scripts are called before Data Scripts and also when the config merges the database config.
